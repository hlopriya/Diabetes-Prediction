Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood glucose levels due to the body’s inability to produce or effectively use insulin. Early diagnosis of diabetes is crucial because delayed detection can lead to long-term complications, including cardiovascular diseases, kidney failure, nerve damage, and vision impairment. With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and machine learning, predictive analytics has become an essential tool to support medical professionals and individuals in identifying risks based on measurable health parameters.
This project presents a machine learning–based diabetes prediction system developed using Python. The model utilizes a publicly available diabetes prediction dataset containing multiple health indicators such as age, BMI, glucose levels, hypertension, heart disease, and lifestyle-related features. The dataset is preprocessed using Label Encoding and Standard Scaling techniques, followed by a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier for prediction. A scrollable, user-friendly graphical interface is created using Tkinter to allow users to input their health data and receive real-time prediction results.
The system aims to provide a quick, accessible, and efficient way to assess diabetes risk. The model's performance, combined with an interactive GUI, demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in healthcare. The project also highlights potential improvements and future enhancements, including advanced models, web deployment, and real-time healthcare integration.
